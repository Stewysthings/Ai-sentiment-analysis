# Deployment Issues Fixed

## Critical Issues Resolved:

### 1. ✅ Corrupted requirements.txt
- **Problem**: File was corrupted with null bytes and Unicode encoding
- **Fix**: Completely rewrote requirements.txt with proper dependencies
- **Impact**: Docker builds and pip installs will now work

### 2. ✅ Missing CORS Configuration
- **Problem**: Flask-CORS was in requirements but not configured in app.py
- **Fix**: Added CORS import and configuration for frontend communication
- **Impact**: Frontend can now communicate with backend API

### 3. ✅ Missing Gunicorn
- **Problem**: Dockerfile used Gunicorn but it wasn't in requirements.txt
- **Fix**: Added gunicorn==21.2.0 to requirements.txt
- **Impact**: Production deployment will work with Gunicorn

### 4. ✅ Incomplete app.py Structure
- **Problem**: Placeholder comments instead of actual code
- **Fix**: Added proper imports, routes, and startup configuration
- **Impact**: Application will start and run properly

### 5. ✅ Port Configuration Mismatch
- **Problem**: Dockerfile exposed port 5000 but config defaulted to 10000
- **Fix**: Updated config.py to default to port 5000
- **Impact**: Consistent port configuration across Docker and local development

### 6. ✅ API Key Type Mismatch
- **Problem**: Config stored API_KEYS as list but app.py checked as set
- **Fix**: Updated app.py to convert to set for membership testing
- **Impact**: API authentication will work correctly

### 7. ✅ Test File Issues
- **Problem**: Tests didn't include required API key headers
- **Fix**: Added proper API key headers and additional test cases
- **Impact**: Tests will pass and provide better coverage

### 8. ✅ Model Loading Robustness
- **Problem**: Batch script didn't handle missing models gracefully
- **Fix**: Added error handling and automatic model downloading
- **Impact**: Scripts will work even if models aren't pre-cached

### 9. ✅ Health Check Timing
- **Problem**: Docker health check started too early (5s)
- **Fix**: Increased start period to 60s for model loading
- **Impact**: Health checks won't fail during model initialization

## Next Steps for Deployment:

### 1. Create Environment File
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your actual values
```

### 2. Test Local Development
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### 3. Test Docker Build
```bash
docker build -t sentiment-api .
docker run -p 5000:5000 --env-file .env sentiment-api
```

### 4. Test API Endpoints
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# Prediction (replace with your API key)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: your_api_key_here" \
  -d '{"text": "This is a great day!"}'
```

### 5. Run Tests
```bash
pip install pytest
pytest tests/
```

## Environment Variables Needed:

- `SECRET_KEY`: Flask secret key for sessions
- `API_KEYS`: Comma-separated list of valid API keys
- `MODEL_PATH`: Path to store/load models (default: ./models)
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: CORS origins (default: localhost:3000,localhost:5173)
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 5000)
- `FLASK_ENV`: Environment (development/production)

## Common Deployment Platforms:

### Render.com
- Set environment variables in dashboard
- Use `gunicorn app:app` as start command
- Ensure PORT environment variable is set

### Railway
- Connect GitHub repository
- Set environment variables
- Deploy automatically on push

### Docker/Kubernetes
- Build image with `docker build -t sentiment-api .`
- Run with environment file or individual env vars
- Ensure persistent storage for models if needed

## Performance Considerations:

1. **Model Caching**: First request will be slow due to model download
2. **Memory Usage**: DistilBERT requires ~250MB RAM
3. **CPU Usage**: Consider GPU deployment for high throughput
4. **Disk Space**: Models require ~500MB storage

## Security Notes:

1. **API Keys**: Use strong, unique API keys in production
2. **CORS**: Restrict origins to your actual frontend domains
3. **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS in production (handled by platform usually)
4. **Rate Limiting**: Current implementation has basic rate limiting
